<div>
The build number of the selected build will be recorded
into the variable named <tt>COPYARTIFACT_BUILD_NUMBER_(SUFFIX)</tt>
for later build steps to reference.
You can specify that suffix part for that variable here.
<p>
If not specified, the source project name will be used instead
(in all uppercase, and sequences of characters other than A-Z
replaced by a single underscore).
<p><strong>Example</strong>:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Source project name</th>
    <th>Suffix to be used</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Project-ABC</td>
    <td>PROJECT_ABC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tool1-release1.2</td>
    <td>TOOL_RELEASE_</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
