Jenkins launches only one build when multiple upstreams triggered the same project at the same time.
This field specifies from which upstream build to copy artifacts in those cases.
If checked, copies artifacts from the upstream build with the largest build number (that is, newest).
If not checked, copies artifacts from the upstream build with the smallest build number (that is, oldest).
